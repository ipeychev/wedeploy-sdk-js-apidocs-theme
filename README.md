# WeDeploy JS SDK default theme

This is the default theme of WeDeploy JS SDK. It has been built on top of the default theme of [documentationjs](https://github.com/documentationjs).
It consists of underscore templates and a few assets: a [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)
theme and [basscss](http://www.basscss.com/) as a basic CSS framework.

The contents are the following:

* `index._`, the main template that defines the document structure
* `section._`, a partial used to render each chunk of documentation
* `assets/*`, any assets, including CSS & JS
